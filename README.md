First of all, we are waiting to get a new server.  For now, some of this (i.e. the signin system) can be done on Mike's server, but it will only be temporary.  The following is a list of things that need to be done to our website.

* Meeting card-swipe signin system.
* Members only section via eRaider SHIM (making the parts form private as well)
* Content Management System (custom, or re-skinned pre-existing?)
* Linking to facebook and twitter
 * "Like" button
 * News feeds
* Sponsorship area
* Live readings area for streaming data from car
 * Video
 * Sensors
 * Other useful information, noted below are what we have thought of so far.  These are only poss possibilities, and not all are expected to be implemented.
  * GPS
  * Route info
  * Current time
  * Battery Status
  * Solar current flow status (Maybe via diagram based on solar array configurations?)
  * Video
  * Temperatures
   * Cockpit
   * Solar Array
   * Batteries
   * Outside Ambient Temperature
  * Speed
  * Regenerative systems usefulness/contributions

The following are optional, but would be great if we can get them in:

* blog
* vlog
* Image Gallery
* Open source repository?  It would be nice, but I don't know if Jordan is entirely on board with this idea.  Either way, good to have noted here for the time being.
* Github notices/updates

Desktop
-------

Here are the current projects which we will be creating for the car itself.  These may be created in part now (possibly), but mostly are going to be on the back burner until we have some actual hardware to get readings from.

* Supporting car data reader (reading wireless signals of sensor data send from solarcar).
* Driver display (if digital)
* Mobile programs (if we get a sprint deal)
* Card reader program (though, it may end up entirely web based)
